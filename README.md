Using TypeScript makes the weather widget more reliable and easier to work with. Because TypeScript checks your code before it runs, it's easier to catch mistakes early. This helps avoid bugs and keeps the code clean and easier to understand, especially when working in teams.
We can also show extra details like "feels like" temperature, wind speed, or humidity. To make the app faster, we can save results for a short time (called caching), so it doesn't need to call the weather API every time. Adding language support (like Spanish or French) and improving screen reader support would also make it more accessible to more users. Finally, turning the widget into a PWA (Progressive Web App) would let people install it on their phone or use it offline.
